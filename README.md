# Installation

1. Install Node.js on your environment: 
 - For Mac users, just type `brew install node` in your command line;
 - For Ubuntu, just type `sudo apt-get update`, then `sudo apt-get install nodejs` and then `sudo apt-get install npm`;
 - For Windows, I don't know -- Google it. 
2. Check that everything installed correctly by running `npm -v` & `node -v`. 
3. Clone this repository with `https://github.com/alexboii/Amigo-2-Amigo-Chat/`, navigate to the folder and run `npm install` and then `npm run dev`.
4. You should see an electron app appear.
